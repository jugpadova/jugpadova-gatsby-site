Today I want to introduce you into XOM, which is one of the two
arguments I'm going to talk about in our [next
meeting](http://upcoming.org/event/50575/) (the second is JSF 1.2).\
What is XOM? Someone could think it's yet another XML library. In part
that's true.\
In Javapolis I attended to XOM's father, Elliotte Rusty Harold, talk.
Harold wrote a very good [book about
XML](http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/) and as he said during
the conference, only after writing that book he can say that he is able
to manage all the problem arising with DOM, JDOM and dom4j. So he
proposes a new library which in his aim is correct, easy to use and easy
to learn.

What lacked his presentation was some live examples, so in the next
meeting I get into code in order to compare those libraries. I'll show
you some common pitfalls using DOM api, and what are the counterparts in
XOM.

If you want to check out XOM you can go to the [main
site](http://www.xom.nu). In Harold's site you can find the [javapolis
slides](http://www.cafeconleche.org/slides/javapolis/xom/)
