AAMS, a branch of italian government, impose to all Italian Internet
Service Provider to inhibit access to a set of sites, the most part of
them connected with gamble games. You can find this list
\[here\](http://www.aams.it/site.php?page=20060213093339418).\
I think that this disposition represents a serious limitation of
freedom. In order to contrast this regulation I suggest to use Torpark
browser, that permits, using a own computer's net, going everywhere u
want. Try to go for example at this \[link\](http://www.007bets.com/)
using firefox, then, after u have installed torpark in your laptop, try
with torpak...and u will see that there isn't limitation. Enjoy with
torpark ;-)

Enrico.
