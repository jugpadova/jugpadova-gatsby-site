In these days, the version 1.4 of the \[Java 3D
API\](https://java3d.dev.java.net/) has been released.

The Maintenance Release under the Java Community Process (JCP) is
defined by \[JSR-926\](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=926) and\
includes the following new features:

\- Programmable shader support<br/>

\- Default values for read capability bits<br/>

\- Additional core picking methods<br/>

\- Stencil buffer<br/>\
- Rendering attributes/modes for depth test function

Other minor features have been added and others have been deprecated in
the Java 3D API.

You can find all new and deprecated features in the \[Java 3D API
version 1.4 Change
Log\](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr926/926ChangeLog.html).

One of the most interesting features available with the next release of
the Java 3D API is the\
JOGL integration (Java Bindings for OpenGL,
\[JSR-231\](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=231)) for the access to
native context.

You can follow Java 3D API evolution in the \[Java 3D
