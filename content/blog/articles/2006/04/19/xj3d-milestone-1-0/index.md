Xj3D is an open source X3D browser, developer library and test
environment for the X3D real time 3D content and delivery standard.

> Xj3D is a project of the Web3D\
> Consortium Source Working Group focused on\
> creating a toolkit for VRML97 and X3D content\
> written completely in Java. It serves a dual\
> purpose of being an experimental codebase for\
> trying out new areas of the X3D specification\
> and as a library that we encourage application\
> developers to use within their own application\
> to support X3D technology.
