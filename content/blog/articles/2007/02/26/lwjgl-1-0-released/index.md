After several years of development, finally the first stable release of
the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) arrived.

> The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) is a solution aimed directly
> at professional and amateur Java programmers alike to enable
> commercial quality games to be written in Java. LWJGL provides
> developers access to high performance crossplatform libraries such as
> OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library)
> allowing for state of the art 3D games and 3D sound. Additionally
> LWJGL provides access to controllers such as Gamepads, Steering wheel
> and Joysticks. All in a simple and straight forward API.
