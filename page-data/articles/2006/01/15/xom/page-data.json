Someone could think it’s yet another XML library. In part\nthat’s true.<br>\nIn Javapolis I attended to XOM’s father, Elliotte Rusty Harold, talk.\nHarold wrote a very good <a href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xmljava/\">book about\nXML</a> and as he said during\nthe conference, only after writing that book he can say that he is able\nto manage all the problem arising with DOM, JDOM and dom4j. So he\nproposes a new library which in his aim is correct, easy to use and easy\nto learn.</p>\n<p>What lacked his presentation was some live examples, so in the next\nmeeting I get into code in order to compare those libraries. I’ll show\nyou some common pitfalls using DOM api, and what are the counterparts in\nXOM.</p>\n<p>If you want to check out XOM you can go to the <a href=\"http://www.xom.nu\">main\nsite</a>.
